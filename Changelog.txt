NEW FEATURES in v0.7
--------------------

David Butterworth, May 2012:


NXT++ now supports multiple NXT bricks via USB and/or Bluetooth!

Compatibility remains with earlier versions of NXT++.


New functions:

   std::vector<std::vector<std::string> > ListNXTDevices(bool searchBT);

      Lists the Device Name and MAC Address of all NXT Devices connected 
      via USB and Bluetooth.


   bool OpenNXTDevice(std::string device, bool searchBT);

      Opens a connection to a specific NXT Device, by providing either the 
      Device Name or MAC Address.

      Compatible with multiple NXT Devices!
      You can open simultaneous connections to devices connected by both
      USB or Bluetooth.


Completed in this version:

   std::string NXT::GetName(Comm::NXTComm* comm)
   bool NXT::SetName(Comm::NXTComm* comm, char* name)

      Read the Device Name of an NXT Brick, or
      Set a new Device Name.

      These functions are now fully implemented in this version.


Fixed bugs:

   double NXT::GetFirmwareVersion(Comm::NXTComm* comm)

      Now returns the correct minor version number.
